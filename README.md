## Introduction

A web-based version of "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock" adds a twist to the traditional game by including two more choices, increasing the strategy and fun. Players compete against the computer, testing their decision-making skills in this enhanced version of the game.

## Design of the Website

### Fonts and Colours

The website employs "Lobster" for headings and "Indie Flower" for body text, with a playful yet engaging aesthetic. The background color #240A34 contrasts with text and other elements in colors like #EABE6C and #FFEDD8 to grab attention.

Distinctive and appealing game icons enhance visual appeal and user experience, designed using resources like DALLÂ·E 3, Canva, and Google.
